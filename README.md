 MediaTek “Smart Connection” 
 
As the IoT devices have no user interface, there is no mechanism for users to enter IP configuration details and 
connect to an AP. To overcome this issue MediaTek “Smart Connection” is provided. It provides a mechanism 
whereby a wireless network’s information (SSID, password, Authmode, and customer data) is broadcast. When 
powered up the IoT device listens to detect the broadcast, and can consume it to obtain its wireless network 
settings. The transmissions are also encrypted with a pre-defined key to ensure security. 
 
The SDK provides the Smart Connection library (libelian.a) for Android and iOS. There is also an example app for 
both included in the SDK. This section describes the APIs in that library and how to use them.
